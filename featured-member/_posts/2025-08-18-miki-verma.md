**Hi Miki! Tell us about yourself and your work.**

I’m the Lead Data Scientist at Rewiring America, the leading U.S. nonprofit dedicated to the electrification of American homes. My organization develops data-driven tools, research, policy, and narratives to help facilitate households' transition from fossil-fuel-powered to efficient electric systems.

Last year, I led the development of our Residential Electrification Model—a free API that predicts the bill savings, emissions reductions, and energy impacts of various electrification upgrades at any U.S. address. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is that electricity demand on the U.S. grid is growing for the first time in decades (driven partly by data centers and AI), which is straining capacity and driving up costs. To address this, my team is building a tool to help policymakers design equitable and affordable electricity rate tariffs, and is developing a model to estimate the effect of Distributed Energy Resources (e.g., solar, batteries, load shifting) on reducing peak demand and expanding grid capacity.

Before joining Rewiring America, I earned my Master’s in Machine Learning & Data Science from Stanford and worked as a researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab on cyber-physical security. Last year, I moved to Gothenburg with my partner, who got a job at AI Sweden!

**Any opportunities or collaborations you’re looking for at the moment?**

Since I work remotely for a U.S. organization, I haven’t yet had many opportunities to engage with Sweden’s climate and research communities, but I'd love to start! Given my organization's focus, I’m particularly interested in heat pumps and district heating, where Sweden has been a global leader. I’d be excited to figure out how to translate Swedish successes into actionable insights for the U.S. energy transition -- it's very inspiring! 

**Where can people reach you?**
