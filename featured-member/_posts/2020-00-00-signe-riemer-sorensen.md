**Hi Signe! Tell us about yourself and your work.**

In my view, there are three key pillars to reducing human impact on climate and nature, without significantly degrading our quality of life. The first is understanding our impact, the second is regulation, and the third is new technology.
Much of climate-related AI supports the knowledge base that informs regulation. My focus, however, is on the third: collaborating with industry to apply AI for greater efficiency and reduced resource waste.
For example, through predictive maintenance of electric grids or wind turbines -- avoiding unnecessary replacements -- or by optimising truck routes on construction sites. I work across all kinds of industries, with the common
factor that they all need to combine data with domain knowledge to build robust models that support better decisions. I’m a Senior Research Scientist at the independent Norwegian research institute SINTEF,
where I lead the Analytics and AI group. I also co-lead the Norwegian Center for AI in Decisions, working with over 50 partners from industry and the public sector to advance research that will enable our society to
use AI for improving the decisions we take every day.

_The photo above shows me trying to explain why we should care about making AI stacking card board boxes to save both human labour and CO2._

**Any opportunities or collaborations you’re looking for at the moment?**

I would like to see more collaborations between the climate-AI focusing on our understanding and documentation of climate changes and biodiversity loss, and industry.
I would love to have collaborators who can say where increased efficiency will have the biggest impact.

**Where can people reach you?**

Feel free to reach out through my email or LinkedIn -- or in my office in Oslo!
