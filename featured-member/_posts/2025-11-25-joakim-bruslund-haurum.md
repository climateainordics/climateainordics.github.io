**Hi Joakim! Tell us about yourself and your work.**

Hi! My name is Joakim Bruslund Haurum and I recently started as Assistant Professor at the totally new Vejle Campus of the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) and the Pioneer Centre for AI. I am a Computer Vision researcher specializing in expert tasks such as infrastructure inspections and biodiversity monitoring. I love conducting all types of research from "pure" research where I dive into the specific of niche algorithms for Vision Transformers to more applied research where our work has a very clear path to impact in "the real world" such as detecting defects in sewer pipes.

Most recently I have been especially interested in how to deal with hierarchal data and limited labels in the context of biodiversity monitoring. I also regularly co-organize various scientific workshop in Denmark and top-tier conferences, most recently the Workshop on AI for Climate and Conservation at EurIPS (happening next week!), which spun out through funding from the Pioneer Centre together with Nico Lang and Ankit Kariryaa.Through these project I have had the pleasure of visiting leading researchers in at the Universitat de Barcelona in Spain, the Vector Institute for AI in Canada joining the BIOSCAN project, and most recently the University of Edinburgh in the UK, all of whom I still collaborate with.

**Any opportunities or collaborations you’re looking for at the moment?**

Since both my Assistant Professorship and the SDU Vejle campus are just 4 months old I am actively looking into potential collaborations for future research projects. So if you have an interest in how to deal with the messy data related to expert tasks I would love to chat!
