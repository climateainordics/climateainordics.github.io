<p>
<em>2025-06-25</em> This paper explores the potential for using neural networks to model atmospheric particle formation. The neural network-based model, tasked here to predict cluster binding energies, achieved the target chemical accuracy of less than 1 kcal/mol, although kernel ridge regression had a slightly lower error. Training was over an order of magnitude faster with the neural network compared to kernel ridge regression.

<em>2025-06-24</em> Edmond is a researcher at SLU Aqua (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) within the Unit for Protected Areas and Marine Planning. He is particularly interested in applied research questions related to mapping aquatic biodiversity and using this information to inform conservation decisions. More specifically, he is interested in how we might be able to utilize the power of machine learning and AI to map species and ecosystems, especially where data are limited.

<em>Event date: 2025-08-14.</em></p>
<p>DiGeMERGE 2025 is an international conference organized by researchers from the Digital Emergency Communication (DIGeMERGE) project. Funded under the CHANSE programme by the EU Commission (Horizon 2020) and Nordic research councils, DIGeMERGE explores the role of digital tools and platforms in public emergency communication across the Nordic countries. The conference provides a platform for researchers and students to present their work on the digital transformation of public emergency communication. Whether focusing on emergency management theories, risk analysis methods, or empirical case studies, participants will have the opportunity to share insights and engage with scholars from diverse disciplines, including the natural and social sciences.

<p>Webinar with Markus Pettersson, Chalmers University of Technology. Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, particularly satellite imagery, have recently shown impressive performance in predicting household-level wealth indices, potentially addressing chronic data scarcity in global development research. While these predictions exhibit strong predictive power, they inherently suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, resulting in attenuated estimates of causal treatment effects and thus limiting their utility in policy evaluations. Existing debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), require additional fresh ground-truth data at the downstream causal inference stage, severely restricting their applicability in data-poor environments. In this paper, we introduce and rigorously evaluate two novel correction methodsâ€”linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correctionâ€”that substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled data. Our methods operate on out-of-sample predictions from pre-trained models, treating these models as black-box functions. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear transformation derived from held-out calibration data, while Tweedie's correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from predicted outcomes. Through analytical exercises and experiments using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, we demonstrate that both proposed methods outperform existing data-free approaches, can achieve significant reductions in attenuation bias and thus providing more accurate, actionable, and policy-relevant estimates. Our approach represents a generalizable, lightweight toolkit that enhances the reliability of causal inference when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable.
