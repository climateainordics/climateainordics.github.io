<em>2025-10-24</em> This paper presents a method to continuously detect urban changes in high-resolution satellite image time series (SITS). Traditional urban change detection models often rely on bi-temporal image pairs acquired multiple years apart, limiting their ability to capture gradual, ongoing urbanization processes. The paper introduces a deep learning framework, including two novel modules to enhance segmentation feature maps extracted from SITS and integrate multi-task model outputs (i.e., building segmentations and dense change information). The paper’s findings show the limitations of bi-temporal change detection methods, as they cannot exploit multitemporal information in SITS. In contrast, their continuous urban change detection method achieves accurate urbanization monitoring results even at short time intervals.

<p>Webinar with Nora Gourmelon, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). The factors influencing melt at glacier fronts facing the ocean remain an active area of research. To better understand these factors, it is essential to monitor changes in glacier calving fronts. Due to the importance of weather-dependent and seasonal variations, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the preferred imaging method for such monitoring. In recent years, deep learning models have been developed to automate the extraction of calving front positions, however, their performance on SAR data remains suboptimal. Limited labeled data and high variability in SAR images hinder traditional supervised learning. Foundation models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets could provide robust feature representations that require minimal labeled data for fine-tuning on specific SAR tasks. However, in preliminary experiments, we found that the domain gap is too large for the task of extracting calving fronts from SAR imagery, and foundation models fine-tuned on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe) benchmark dataset performed subpar. Therefore, we compiled an unlabeled dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR image sequences of Arctic glaciers, each associated with a single Sentinel-2 optical reference image. Using this dataset, we developed a novel multi-modal self-supervised pre-training strategy and applied it to pre-train a hybrid CNN-transformer model. Fine-tuning on the CaFFe benchmark showed that the pre-trained model outperforms its non-pre-trained counterpart, enabling more robust calving front segmentation and demonstrating the potential of data-efficient learning for SAR imagery.

<p>Webinar with Katarzyna Michalowska, SINTEF. In real-world applications, collecting large amounts of high-resolution data is rarely practical. The cost of specialized equipment, time-intensive measurements, and expensive high-fidelity simulations often means that high-resolution samples are limited. Meanwhile, low-resolution data are far easier to obtain and often exist in abundance, creating a common scenario: plentiful coarse data but limited fine data. Standard neural networks, which require fixed-resolution inputs, cannot exploit this imbalance and typically perform poorly when generalizing across resolutions. Deep operator networks, or DeepONets offer a distinct advantage over standard neural networks through a property known as discretization invariance, enabling learning across varying data resolutions. However, DeepONets alone do not effectively capture long-term temporal dependencies, limiting their performance on problems involving long time horizons. In this talk, we present a framework that addresses both challenges: multi-resolution learning and long-time horizon modelling. We achieve this by extending DeepONets with long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and introducing a multi-stage training procedure that leverages data at multiple resolutions. This hybrid architecture first learns global dynamics from abundant low-resolution data and then fine-tunes on limited high-resolution samples, capturing both multi-resolution structure and temporal dependencies. In tests on nonlinear dynamical systems, our multi-resolution DON-LSTM achieves lower generalization error and requires fewer high-resolution samples than standard DeepONet or LSTM models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is well-suited for real-world scenarios where high-resolution data are limited, highlighting its potential for practical applications across science and engineering.

<em>This event took place 2025-10-09.</em> Webinar with Sebastian Hafner, RISE. Urbanization is progressing at an unprecedented rate in many places around the world, making Earth observation (EO) a vital tool for monitoring its dynamics on a global scale. Modern satellite missions provide new opportunities for urban mapping and change detection (CD) through high-resolution imagery. At the same time, EO data analysis has advanced from traditional machine learning approaches to deep learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Yet, current DL methods for urban mapping and CD face key challenges, including effectively integrating multi-modal EO data, reducing reliance on large labeled datasets, and improving transferability across geographic regions. This talk will present methods to address these challenges in urban mapping and CD, with applications such as multi-hazard building damage detection. It will also highlight the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project, showing how its community-centric approach advances our understanding of urban deprivation and enables DL-based deprivation mapping.
