<p>Webinar with Nora Gourmelon, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). The factors influencing melt at glacier fronts facing the ocean remain an active area of research. To better understand these factors, it is essential to monitor changes in glacier calving fronts. Due to the importance of weather-dependent and seasonal variations, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the preferred imaging method for such monitoring. In recent years, deep learning models have been developed to automate the extraction of calving front positions, however, their performance on SAR data remains suboptimal. Limited labeled data and high variability in SAR images hinder traditional supervised learning. Foundation models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets could provide robust feature representations that require minimal labeled data for fine-tuning on specific SAR tasks. However, in preliminary experiments, we found that the domain gap is too large for the task of extracting calving fronts from SAR imagery, and foundation models fine-tuned on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe) benchmark dataset performed subpar. Therefore, we compiled an unlabeled dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR image sequences of Arctic glaciers, each associated with a single Sentinel-2 optical reference image. Using this dataset, we developed a novel multi-modal self-supervised pre-training strategy and applied it to pre-train a hybrid CNN-transformer model. Fine-tuning on the CaFFe benchmark showed that the pre-trained model outperforms its non-pre-trained counterpart, enabling more robust calving front segmentation and demonstrating the potential of data-efficient learning for SAR imagery.

<p>Webinar with Sebastian Hafner, RISE. Urbanization is progressing at an unprecedented rate in many places around the world, making Earth observation (EO) a vital tool for monitoring its dynamics on a global scale. Modern satellite missions provide new opportunities for urban mapping and change detection (CD) through high-resolution imagery. At the same time, EO data analysis has advanced from traditional machine learning approaches to deep learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Yet, current DL methods for urban mapping and CD face key challenges, including effectively integrating multi-modal EO data, reducing reliance on large labeled datasets, and improving transferability across geographic regions. This talk will present methods to address these challenges in urban mapping and CD, with applications such as multi-hazard building damage detection. It will also highlight the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project, showing how its community-centric approach advances our understanding of urban deprivation and enables DL-based deprivation mapping.

<em>This event took place 2025-06-19.</em> Webinar with Lily Xu, Columbia University. Like many of society's grand challenges, biodiversity conservation requires effectively allocating and managing our limited resources in the face of imperfect information. My research develops data-driven AI decision-making methods to do so, overcoming the messy data ubiquitous in these settings. Here, I’ll present technical advances in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and causal inference, addressing research questions that emerged from on-the-ground challenges in wildlife conservation. I’ll also discuss bridging the gap from research and practice, with anti-poaching field tests in Cambodia, field visits in Belize and Uganda, and large-scale deployment with SMART conservation software.

<p>
<em>This event took place 2025-09-11.</em> Webinar with Georges Le Bellier, CNAM. Deep learning for remote sensing plays a crucial role in turning satellite and aerial imagery into dependable, real-world insights. However, Earth observation models must handle diverse environments, sensors, and conditions—such as clouds, seasonal shifts, and geographic differences—while still producing accurate results. In this talk, we explore two paths that lead to more robust and adaptable algorithms: generative domain adaptation and geospatial foundation models. First, I will introduce FlowEO, a generative approach of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Earth observation, and show its high performance in UDA scenarios for several downstream tasks, including dense prediction and classification. This flow-matching-based translation method improves pretrained predictive models' accuracies in challenging scenarios such as post-disaster response and high cloud coverage cases with SAR-to-optical translation. FlowEO’s generative domain adaptation method is independent of the downstream task and does not require retraining the predictive model. Then, I will present “PANGAEA: A Global and Inclusive Benchmark for Geospatial Foundation Models“, a standardized evaluation protocol that covers a diverse set of datasets, dense prediction tasks, resolutions, sensor modalities, and temporalities. This benchmark includes comparison between geospatial foundation models but also with supervised baselines, namely U-Net and ViT, and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of GFMs. In addition, PANGAEA evaluates models’ accuracy in cases where labels are limited and questions the impact of multi-temporal data for GFMs.

<em>This event took place 2025-08-28.</em> Webinar with Markus Pettersson, Chalmers University of Technology. Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, particularly satellite imagery, have recently shown impressive performance in predicting household-level wealth indices, potentially addressing chronic data scarcity in global development research. While these predictions exhibit strong predictive power, they inherently suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, resulting in attenuated estimates of causal treatment effects and thus limiting their utility in policy evaluations. Existing debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), require additional fresh ground-truth data at the downstream causal inference stage, severely restricting their applicability in data-poor environments. In this paper, we introduce and rigorously evaluate two novel correction methods—linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction—that substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled data. Our methods operate on out-of-sample predictions from pre-trained models, treating these models as black-box functions. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear transformation derived from held-out calibration data, while Tweedie's correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from predicted outcomes. Through analytical exercises and experiments using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, we demonstrate that both proposed methods outperform existing data-free approaches, can achieve significant reductions in attenuation bias and thus providing more accurate, actionable, and policy-relevant estimates. Our approach represents a generalizable, lightweight toolkit that enhances the reliability of causal inference when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable.

<em>This event took place 2025-09-25.</em> Webinar with Sigrid Passano Hellan, NORCE Norwegian Research Centre. If you don’t want to be setting and tuning machine learning model hyperparameters such as the learning rate yourself, then hyperparameter tuning is a good alternative. Also called hyperparameter optimisation, it has been developed to reduce the amount of machine learning experience required to set up a model by automatically finding the best hyperparameters. By reducing these hurdles to adoption, machine learning can be adopted for more climate applications. Bayesian optimisation is a popular method for hyperparameter optimisation, and consists of fitting a probabilistic model and using that to inform the optimisation process. Both hyperparameter optimisation and Bayesian optimisation can be greatly enhanced using transfer learning, where we learn from previous optimisation problems to speed up the current one. In this talk I will give an introduction to methods for hyperparameter tuning and Bayesian optimisation, and how transfer learning can be used. Then I will present how Bayesian optimisation has been applied to climate related research, as we discussed in a recent survey. We found the main application areas to be material discovery – finding better materials for solar panels; wind farm layouts – deciding where to place turbines; optimal control of renewables – e.g. adjusting wind turbine blade angles to current conditions; and environmental monitoring – e.g. finding pollution maxima.
