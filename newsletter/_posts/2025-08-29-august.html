<p>Welcome to the August edition of the Climate AI Nordics Newsletter!</p>
<p>Since launching in October 2024, our community has grown to 176 members across the Nordic region and 56 international affiliates. Together, we connect researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and climate actionâ€”spanning mitigation, adaptation, and environmental monitoring.</p>

<p>
<em>2025-08-25</em> The featured paper this month shows how Bayesian optimisation can support climate change mitigation by tackling optimisation problems in renewable energy and environmental monitoring. This includes a review on applications across four main use casesâ€”material discovery, wind farm layouts, optimal renewable control, and environmental monitoring, and the proposal of benchmark problems to guide future research. The work is connected to ongoing projects at Climate AI Nordics, such as efforts to design safer solar panel materials and improve air pollution monitoring.

<em>Event date: 2025-09-11.</em></p>
<p>Webinar with Georges Le Bellier, Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers. Deep learning for remote sensing is key to turning satellite and aerial imagery into real-world insights, but models must handle diverse sensors, environments, and conditions such as clouds and seasonal changes. The talk explores two approaches to building more robust algorithms: generative domain adaptation and geospatial foundation models. FlowEO will be presented as a generative method for unsupervised domain adaptation with high predictive accuracy across tasks, including post-disaster response and SAR-to-optical translation, without retraining the base model. The webinar will also cover PANGAEA, an evaluation protocol for geospatial foundation models that covers several datasets, modalities, and temporalities, comparing them with supervised baselines. PANGAEA highlights the strengths and weaknesses of GFMs, especially under limited annotations, and examines the role of multi-temporal data.

<p>Webinar with Nora Gourmelon, Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (FAU). Monitoring glacier calving fronts with SAR imagery is essential but challenging, as deep learning models often underperform due to limited labeled data and high variability. To address this, an unlabeled Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical dataset was compiled, enabling a novel multi-modal self-supervised pre-training strategy for a hybrid CNN-transformer model. Fine-tuning on the CaFFe benchmark showed clear improvements over non-pre-trained models, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient learning for calving front segmentation.

<em>This event took place 2025-08-26.</em> The Norwegian government has announced six new national research centers for artificial intelligence, backed by over NOK 1 billion over five years. While their main missions range from education to robotics, creativity, and decision-making, sustainability, ethics, and environmental responsibility are important themes in several. Many PhD positions on relevant topics will be announced in the coming year. The centers will be presented in a public online event on August 26.
