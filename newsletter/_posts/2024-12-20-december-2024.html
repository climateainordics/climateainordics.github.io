    <h2>Featured Paper: ONEKANA: Modelling Thermal Inequalities in African Cities</h2>
    <img src="https://climateainordics.com/images/posts/2024-12-03-featured-paper.png"/>
    <p><em>2024-12-03</em> The new Climate AI Nordics Featured Paper is &#x201C;ONEKANA: Modelling Thermal Inequalities in African Cities&#x201D; by Sabine Vanhuysse and colleagues. This research addresses the pressing issue of thermal disparities in rapidly urbanizing African cities, where vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by extreme heat due to environmental and socioeconomic factors.<br/>

    <p><em>This event takes place 2025-01-30 15:00.</em> Webinar with Amal Nammouchi, Karlstad University and AfriClimate AI. As climate change issues become more pressing, their impact in Africa calls for urgent, innovative solutions tailored to the continent&#x2019;s unique challenges. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a critical and valuable tool for climate change adaptation and mitigation, its effectiveness and potential are contingent upon overcoming significant challenges such as data scarcity, infrastructure gaps, and limited local AI development. This talk explores the role of AI in climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa. It advocates for a collaborative approach to build capacity, develop open-source data repositories, and create context-aware, robust AI-driven climate solutions that are culturally and contextually relevant.<br/>

      <a href="http:///climateainordics.com/people/" target="_blank">
        <em>network of researchers</em>
      </a>
      <em> dedicated to developing and utilizing AI technologies to address the urgent global challenge of climate change. Our researchers focus on creating and promoting AI solutions that support both climate change mitigation, reducing the severity of climate change, and adaptation, adjusting to the effects of climate change. We are already in a climate emergency which is causing biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, and human suffering, and this necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both policy change, limitations on activities contributing to climate change, and bolstering societal resilience against climate-related events.</em>
