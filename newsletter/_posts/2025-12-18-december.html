<p>
<em>2025-12-15</em> Climate AI Nordics joined the inaugural EurIPS conference in Copenhagen last week, connecting with the community at our booth shared with the Nordic AI Partnership and Pioneer Centre for AI. On Saturday, we successfully hosted the full-day AICC workshop, featuring an inspiring lineup of speakers and over 30 posters bridging machine learning and climate science. While the research highlights covered diverse topics like weather forecasting, a significant portion of the program focused on analyzing forests as vital carbon sinks and biodiversity havens. We are grateful to our partners and all amazing researchers from around Europe and the rest of the world for supporting this memorable week of collaboration, glögg, and impactful science.

<em>This event took place 2025-12-11.</em> Webinar with Zhengpeng (Frank) Feng, Cambridge. Petabytes of satellite Earth Observation (EO) data are freely available and can address critical global challenges. However, EO data quality is poor due to clouds and variable lighting conditions. To address this, practitioners typically use compositing, but this critically removes the temporal phenological signal. Moreover, supervised machine learning to map composited pixels to task-specific classes requires accurately labelled data that are rarely available. We present TESSERA, a pixel-oriented foundation model for EO time series that creates 128-dimensional latent embeddings requiring only a few labels for task-specific training to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse complex tasks. TESSERA uses two encoders that combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10m resolution, creating embeddings fused with a multilayer perceptron to generate annual global embedding maps. TESSERA closely matches or outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models across five diverse downstream tasks. It is unprecedented in ease of use, scale, and accuracy: no other open foundation model provides precomputed outputs with global, annual coverage at 10m resolution.
