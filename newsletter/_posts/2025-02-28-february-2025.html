<p><em>This event takes place 2025-03-06.</em> Webinar with Atakan Aral, University of Vienna. The integration of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence (i.e., Edge AI) unlocks new possibilities for remote monitoring of water quality across diverse environments. This talk will explore the dual aspects of "remote" monitoring: (1) collecting water quality data in geographically remote regions with limited energy and connectivity and (2) using connected water quality sensors to gain real-time insights remotely. By deploying low-power or energy-harvesting sensors and learning from data in close proximity to sensors, we can improve efficiency, reduce latency, and maintain learning performance in challenging environments without reliable communication and energy infrastructures. The presentation will showcase two real-world case studies in river pollution source identification and monitoring of water distribution systems.<br> <strong><a href="https://climateainordics.com/events/2025-02-27-2025-03-06-edge-ai-and-iot-driven-water-quality">(Read more)</a></strong></p>

<p><em>This event took place 2025-02-20.</em> Webinar with Abdulhakim Abdi, Lund University. In the face of a global biodiversity crisis, the ability to efficiently monitor ecological change across space and time has never been more accessible. Advances in satellite remote sensing and AI have opened new frontiers for biodiversity monitoring by offering powerful tools to analyze vast datasets, automate species detection, and improve disturbance tracking. While these technologies hold great promise, their widespread adoption faces key challenges, including data accessibility, environmental costs, model interpretability, and the need for stronger interdisciplinary collaboration. This presentation explores the opportunities and limitations of tech-driven nature conservation, assessing whether current developments are sufficient to bridge critical knowledge gaps. The integration of remote sensing with AI brings us closer to a more data-informed approach to managing the living world - but are we truly ready to harness its full potential?<br> <strong><a href="https://climateainordics.com/events/2025-02-04-2025-02-20-tech-informed-nature-conservation-are-we">(Read more)</a></strong></p><h1 id="spread-the-word">Spread the word!</h1>

<p><em>Climate AI Nordics is a <a href="/people/">network of researchers</a> dedicated to developing and utilizing AI technologies to address the urgent global challenge of climate change. Our researchers focus on creating and promoting AI solutions that support both climate change mitigation, reducing the severity of climate change, and adaptation, adjusting to the effects of climate change. We are already in a climate emergency which is causing biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, and human suffering, and this necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both policy change, limitations on activities contributing to climate change, and bolstering societal resilience against climate-related events.</em></p>
<p><em>Climate AI Nordics promotes the development of AI-based analytical tools and optimization techniques that can inform decision-making processes crucial for ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come. In particular, we recognize that technology, particularly AI-based solutions, can play a role in supporting efforts such as rewilding, rewetting, and reducing emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels.</em></p>
<p><em>By bringing together researchers in the Nordic countries, Climate AI Nordics aims to:</em></p><ul><li><em>Foster collaboration and knowledge exchange through seminars and workshops.</em></li><li><em>Help develop AI-driven solutions that contribute to the creation of climate-friendly products and services, optimize processes for efficiency and sustainability, and promote justice in addressing the impacts of climate change.</em></li></ul>
<p><em>We hope that the collaborative nature of Climate AI Nordics will accelerate progress in this critical field, enabling the sharing of expertise and resources to develop impactful AI solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.</em>
