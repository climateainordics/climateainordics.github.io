<em>2025-01-27</em> The new Climate AI Nordics Featured Paper is ‚ÄúDeep learning-enhanced detection of road culverts in high-resolution digital elevation models: Improving stream network accuracy in Sweden‚Äù by William Lidberg. In this work, Lidberg combines LiDAR data and aerial imagery with deep learning to detect 87 % of all road culverts in Sweden. These culverts are in turn used to increase the accuracy of maps featuring small watercourses.<br> <strong>

<em>This event takes place 2025-02-06.</em> Webinar with Benjamin Cretois, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. Advancing biodiversity monitoring is crucial for meeting the EU Biodiversity Strategy targets and addressing gaps in current ecological assessments. However, collecting data to monitor the state of biodiversity is time and resource consuming. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM), in combination with AI tools offers an efficient alternative to conventional data collection practices. PAM is a non-invasive method that uses sound recorders to capture wildlife vocalizations and environmental sounds over time. It is particularly valuable for monitoring elusive or nocturnal species, such as birds, amphibians, and marine mammals, that are challenging to detect visually. The "Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring Network" (TABMON) project is an initiative to establish a transnational passive acoustic monitoring monitoring network using autonomous acoustic sensors across four different European countries: Norway, Netherlands, France and Spain. TABMON‚Äôs objective is to demonstrate how acoustic sensing, coupled with cutting-edge AI, can complement traditional monitoring methods and support the development of methods to better monitor biodiversity. In this talk, we will also share our experiences with the deployment of acoustic recorders, data management strategies, and annotation protocols. These include managing large-scale, networked deployments across diverse landscapes, designing an efficient annotation workflow, and leveraging AI tools to process and analyze massive datasets.<br> <strong>

<em>Climate AI Nordics is a <a href="/people/">network of researchers</a> dedicated to developing and utilizing AI technologies to address the urgent global challenge of climate change. Our researchers focus on creating and promoting AI solutions that support both climate change mitigation, reducing the severity of climate change, and adaptation, adjusting to the effects of climate change. We are already in a climate emergency which is causing biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, and human suffering, and this necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both policy change, limitations on activities contributing to climate change, and bolstering societal resilience against climate-related events.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Climate AI Nordics promotes the development of AI-based analytical tools and optimization techniques that can inform decision-making processes crucial for ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come. In particular, we recognize that technology, particularly AI-based solutions, can play a role in supporting efforts such as rewilding, rewetting, and reducing emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>By bringing together researchers in the Nordic countries, Climate AI Nordics aims to:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Foster collaboration and knowledge exchange through seminars and workshops.</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>Help develop AI-driven solutions that contribute to the creation of climate-friendly products and services, optimize processes for efficiency and sustainability, and promote justice in addressing the impacts of climate change.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>We hope that the collaborative nature of Climate AI Nordics will accelerate progress in this critical field, enabling the sharing of expertise and resources to develop impactful AI solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.</em>
