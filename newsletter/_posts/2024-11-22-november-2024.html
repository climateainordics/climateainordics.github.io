<p><em>This event takes place 2024-11-28 15:00.</em> Webinar with
Alireza Taheri Dehkordi, Lund University. The global decline in
water quality, exacerbated by climate change and population growth,
underscores the need for continuous and accurate monitoring of
water quality parameters (WQPs). Remote sensing (RS) data,
especially from multispectral satellites like Sentinel-2 and
Landsat-8, offers large-scale, periodic observations for tracking
WQPs. However, deriving accurate estimates solely from RS data is
complex due to the intricate relationships between spectral bands
and water quality indicators. This talk presents two novel machine
learning approaches that leverage advanced RS data processing to
enhance water quality monitoring.<br>

<p><em>2024-11-12</em> As COP29 is convening in Azerbajdzjan, Olof
Mogren, co-founder of Climate Change AI Nordics was interviewed in
Computer Sweden. “When it comes to climate change, we have to work
broadly both with mitigation techniques and by adapting to the
effects we are already seeing”. “AI can be a tool to support these
efforts”.<br>

<p><em>This event happened 2024-11-07 15:00.</em> Webinar with Joel
Oskarsson, Linköping University. Recent years have seen rapid
progress in using machine learning models for weather forecasting.
These models show impressive performance, matching or even
outperforming existing physics-based models, while running in a
fraction of the time. This is fundamentally and rapidly changing
the landscape of weather forecasting today. In this talk I will
discuss the factors that enabled this paradigm shift, the core
machine learning methods used and the research questions at the
bleeding edge of machine learning for weather. In particular I will
focus on how current methods can be extended to regional and
probabilistic forecasting. For regional forecasting I will showcase
graph-based methods for building limited area weather forecasting
models. I will also discuss how generative machine learning methods
can enable probabilistic forecasting, giving much-needed estimates
of uncertainty and allowing for predicting extreme weather
events.<br>

<p><em>This event happened 2024-11-21 15:00.</em> Webinar with Alp
Kucukelbir, Columbia University. Artificial intelligence (AI) has
the potential to make very significant contributions to climate
change mitigation. The complexity and scale of the challenge is
broad. In this talk, I break down opportunities for AI to effect
incremental and transformational change across multiple sectors,
focusing on industries with large carbon footprints. I highlight
barriers and risks to the adoption of AI, including the carbon
footprint of AI usage worldwide. I focus on the multiple
definitions (and ultimate importance) of "trust in AI" and its
impact on the integration of AI into complex workflows. This talk
is for AI practitioners looking to understand how AI fits into the
bigger picture of climate change. I highlight opportunities and
challenges in each sector that I hope will motivate collaboration
across academia and industry.<br>

<p><em>CCAI Nordics are a <a href="/people/">network of
researchers</a> dedicated to developing and utilizing AI
technologies to address the urgent global challenge of climate
change. Our researchers focus on creating and promoting AI
solutions that support both climate change mitigation, reducing the
severity of climate change, and adaptation, adjusting to the
effects of climate change. We are already in a climate emergency
which is causing biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, and
human suffering, and this necessitates a multifaceted approach
involving both policy change, limitations on activities
contributing to climate change, and bolstering societal resilience
against climate-related events.</em></p>
<p><em>CCAI Nordics promotes the development of AI-based analytical
tools and optimization techniques that can inform decision-making
processes crucial for ensuring a sustainable future for generations
to come. In particular, we recognize that technology, particularly
AI-based solutions, can play a role in supporting efforts such as
rewilding, rewetting, and reducing emissions and the reliance on
fossil fuels.</em></p>
<p><em>By bringing together researchers in the Nordic countries,
CCAI Nordics aims to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Foster collaboration and knowledge exchange through
seminars and workshops.</em></li>
<li><em>Help develop AI-driven solutions that contribute to the
creation of climate-friendly products and services, optimize
processes for efficiency and sustainability, and promote justice in
addressing the impacts of climate change.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>We hope that the collaborative nature of CCAI Nordics will
accelerate progress in this critical field, enabling the sharing of
expertise and resources to develop impactful AI solutions for
climate change mitigation and adaptation.</em></p>
