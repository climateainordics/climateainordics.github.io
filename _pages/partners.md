### Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes

![](/images/partners/climes.png)

The Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes (climes) is a platform for research and training to promote scientific progress in the study of climate extremes and support societal resilience. The centre bridges the physical, medical, social and engineering sciences and focuses on three overarching themes: compiling data on impacts of climate extremes; investigating the societal and physical interplays determining the impacts of an extreme; and building policy-actionable scenarios of impacts of future extremes. The Centre is funded by the Swedish Research Council.

climes is an **affiliated organization** to Climate AI Nordics. The two share similar goals and objectives and collaborate when useful.
