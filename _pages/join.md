By joining Climate AI Nordics (CAIN), you will receive invitations to seminars and workshops, and you can mark your affiliation with us by showing your name on our [people](/people/) page. You will also be able to share relevant news and events to the network through our web page and our news letter.

If you prefer, feel free to instead sign up by sending your information to us by email, [contact@climateainordics.com](mailto:contact@climateainordics.com).

**Note:** CAIN is a network for individuals working in the intersection of AI, climate change, and the environment. Registering to CAIN does NOT mean that your organization automatically becomes a member of or a partner with CAIN. Please reach out to [contact@climateainordics.com](mailto:contact@climateainordics.com) if you would like to discuss partnerships with CAIN.

If you have news or events relevant to AI for Climate Change in the Nordic region, feel free to inform us about this.

Anyone active within AI for addressing climate change in any way is welcome to join Climate AI Nordics. We don't have a strict requirement for our members to be affiliated with a Nordic institution; neighbours are welcome! However, the content and the events in this network will be based in the Nordic countries. For those of you who get confused about what the Nordics are, have a look at our [about page](/about/).
