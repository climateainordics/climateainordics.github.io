Use the form below to join Climate AI Nordics (CAIN)!

[Click here to open the form in its own window](https://forms.gle/RJ6HgucfwR1eKFfM6).

By joining CAIN, you will receive invitations to seminars and workshops, and you can mark your affiliation with us by showing your name on our [people](/people/) page. You will also be able to share relevant news and events to the network through our webpage and our newsletter, and also communicate with others in the network, e.g. via our Slack workspace.

If you prefer, feel free to instead sign up by sending your information to us by email, [contact@climateainordics.com](mailto:contact@climateainordics.com).

If you or your organization want to support our work through sponsorship, send us an email: [contact@climateainordics.com](mailto:contact@climateainordics.com).

If you have news or events relevant to AI for climate- and environment-related applications in the Nordic region, feel free to inform us about this.

Anyone active within AI for addressing climate change or environmental issues more broadly is welcome to join Climate AI Nordics. Also, we don't have a strict requirement for our members to be affiliated with a Nordic institution; neighbours are welcome! However, the content and the events in this network will be based in the Nordic countries. For those of you who get confused about what the Nordics are, have a look at our [about page](/about/).
