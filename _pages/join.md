Use the form below to join Climate AI Nordics (CAIN)!

The following information is for researchers active within the field of AI and machine learning applied to problems related to the environment and climate change. [If you instead would only like to follow our newsletter and social media, click here!](/follow/)

[Click here to open the form in its own window](https://forms.gle/RJ6HgucfwR1eKFfM6).

By joining Climate AI Nordics (CAIN), you will receive invitations to seminars and workshops, and you can mark your affiliation with us by showing your name on our [people](/people/) page. You will also be able to share relevant news and events to the network through our webpage and our newsletter, and also communicate with others in the network, e.g. via our Slack workspace. Affiliated researchers operating in the Nordic region can also use "Climate AI Nordics" as an additional affiliation in relevant publications (in areas touching the intersection of AI, climate and/or the environment).

If you prefer, feel free to instead sign up by sending your information to us by email, [contact@climateainordics.com](mailto:contact@climateainordics.com).

**Note:** CAIN is a network for individuals working in the intersection of AI, climate change, and the environment. Registering to CAIN does **not** mean that your organization automatically becomes a member of or a partner with CAIN. Please reach out to [contact@climateainordics.com](mailto:contact@climateainordics.com) if you would like to discuss partnerships with CAIN.

If you have news or events relevant to AI for climate- and environment-related applications in the Nordic region, feel free to inform us about this.

Anyone active within AI for addressing climate change or environmental issues more broadly is welcome to join Climate AI Nordics. Also, we don't have a strict requirement for our members to be affiliated with a Nordic institution; neighbours are welcome! However, the content and the events in this network will be based in the Nordic countries, and adding "Climate AI Nordics" as an affiliation is not allowed for people operating outside the Nordics. For those of you who get confused about what the Nordics are, have a look at our [about page](/about/).
