We are a [network of researchers](/people/) dedicated to developing and utilizing AI technologies to address the urgent global challenge of climate change. Our researchers focus on creating and promoting AI solutions that support both climate change mitigation, reducing the severity of climate change, and adaptation, adjusting to the effects of climate change. We are already in a climate emergency which is causing biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, and human suffering, and this necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both policy change, limitations on activities contributing to climate change, and bolstering societal resilience against climate-related events.

Climate AI Nordics promotes the development of AI-based analytical tools and optimization techniques that can inform decision-making processes crucial for ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come. In particular, we recognize that technology, particularly AI-based solutions, can play a role in supporting efforts such as rewilding, rewetting, and reducing emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels.

By bringing together researchers in the Nordic countries, Climate AI Nordics aims to:

* Foster collaboration and knowledge exchange through seminars and workshops.
* Help develop AI-driven solutions that contribute to the creation of climate-friendly products and services, optimize processes for efficiency and sustainability, and promote justice in addressing the impacts of climate change.

We hope that the collaborative nature of Climate AI Nordics will accelerate progress in this critical field, enabling the sharing of expertise and resources to develop impactful AI solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

## What are the Nordics?

Anyone active within AI for addressing climate change in any way is welcome to join Climate AI Nordics. We don't have a strict requirement for our members to be affiliated with a Nordic institution; neighbours are welcome! However, the content and the events in this network will be based in the Nordic countries. For those of you who are confused about what the Nordic countries are, we refer you to the informative Youtube video from CGP Grey discussing the Nordics, and Scandinavia.
