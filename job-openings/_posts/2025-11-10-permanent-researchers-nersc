The first is about the development of climate prediction using the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model, using data assimilation and machine learning.
We seek a researcher with expertise in seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction to contribute to the development of the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM). The researcher will focus on enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability, including the design and implementation of advanced post-processing solutions.

The second is about machine learning and optical remote sensing: 
We seek a researcher with expertise in marine ecosystem assessment, optical remote sensing and machine learning to develop solutions for monitoring coastal environments and predicting marine hazards such as harmful algal blooms, high biomass blooms, salmon lice, and Vibrio spp.
