Climate Change AI (CCAI, [https://www.climatechange.ai/](https://www.climatechange.ai/)) is looking for new core team members. CCAI empowers a global community of innovators, practitioners, and decision-makers to accelerate responsible climate action through the use of AI, by addressing critical gaps in expertise, education, coordination, and research-to-deployment infrastructure. Core team members are volunteers who are expected to dedicate 5-10 hours of time per week. Most core team members have a background in either machine learning or areas relevant to climate change (such as energy, transportation, climate science, etc.), and a strong interest in both topics.

This recruitment call includes roles related to communications, community and education. Applications will be assessed on a rolling basis, but candidates are expected to be able to start in January 2026.

Full details about the roles we are recruiting for and how to apply are available at:

Climate Change AI is greatly looking forward to receiving your application!

(Note that this is for the world-spanning organization Climate Change AI. Currently, Climate AI Nordics is not looking for Core team members.)
