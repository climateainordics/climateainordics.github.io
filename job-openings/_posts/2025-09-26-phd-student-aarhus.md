Aarhus University’s **Graduate School of Natural Sciences** is offering a **PhD position in remote sensing of vegetation structure in landscapes under transformative change**.  
The project is available from February 2025 or later within the Biology programme, supervised by **Professor Signe Normand** and **Tenure Track Assistant Professor Fabian Daniel Schneider**.

### Project focus
The PhD project aims to understand the spatial scaling, fragmentation, and dynamics of vegetation structure across natural and human-modified landscapes in Denmark and Europe.  
The goal is to quantify the multiscale variation of vegetation structural diversity, with the potential to study temporal dynamics.  

A wide range of methodologies may be applied, including:
- Airborne, UAV, or mobile lidar  
- Spaceborne radar  
- Structure from motion (UAV)  
- Deep learning / AI approaches for vegetation structure analysis  

The position contributes to the **Center for Landscape Research in Sustainable Agricultural Futures (Land-CRAFT)** and will be part of the Section for Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity (ECOINF), Department of Biology.

### Candidate profile
Applicants are expected to hold a Master’s degree in ecology, geoscience, geography, or biology, with experience in one or more of the following:
- Geospatial and statistical analyses of ecological or remote sensing data  
- Programming (e.g., Python, Matlab, or R)  
- Remote sensing (vegetation lidar or radar preferred)  
- Functional ecology or biogeography  

Strong writing skills, interdisciplinary collaboration, and enthusiasm for sustainability and biodiversity research are essential.  

### How to apply
- Deadline: **1 November 2025 at 23:59 CET**  
- Apply via [phd.nat.au.dk](https://phd.nat.au.dk/for-applicants/open-calls/november-2025/phd-in-remote-sensing-of-vegetation-structure-in-landscapes-under-transformative-change)  

The hired PhD student will be based in Aarhus, Denmark.
