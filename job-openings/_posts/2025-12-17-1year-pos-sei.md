Become part of Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), an international non-profit research institute tackling global environment and sustainable development challenges. SEI empowers partners through cutting-edge research, knowledge,
tools and capacity building. You will join a world-leading organization with around 140 employees at its activity-based headquarters in Stockholm and 200 more across seven global centres.
Together, we engage with policy, practice and development action for a sustainable, prosperous future for all.

SEI is recruiting an early-career computer scientist to support development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for data extraction and scientific research in the field of sustainable development.
The position presents an opportunity to work in multiple projects and contribute to data extraction and classification (e.g. for eligibility screening in literature reviews), while applying and
further developing existing new AI-driven tools, methodologies and validation procedures to support research.

The role involves supporting design and maintaining data extraction and classification pipelines for unstructured and semi-structured data sources. It also includes contributing to fine-tuning,
training and evaluation of local Large Language Models and supporting software architecture, using frameworks such as PyTorch, Transformers, VLLM or similar. The position requires excellent problem-solving
abilities and close collaboration with researchers across multiple academic fields.

**Key tasks and responsibilities:**
* Maintain and further develop AI-based tools for literature review and document analysis.
* Design methods for data extraction, classification and processing pipelines for AI-driven research.
* Work with AI development platforms including Hugging Face and GitHub for collaboration and model management, user interfaces such as Chainlit and Streamlit, and platforms for local LLM deployment, such as vLLM and LM Studios.
* Collaborate closely with multidisciplinary research teams across social and environmental domains.
* Support the integration of AI tools into ongoing evidence synthesis and policy-relevant research.

**Deadline:** January 8th, 2026
