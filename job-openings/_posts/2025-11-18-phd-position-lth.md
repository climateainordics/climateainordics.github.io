Lund University has an open PhD position for a doctoral student in environmental science. The project is integrated within the larger interdisciplinary project [BIOSPACE](https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/projects/biodiversity-from-space-optimized-grazing-and-biodiversity-conser-2/).

We are looking for a candidate with a master's degree in environmental sciences, geography, ecology, agricultural sciences, or other relevant areas. The doctoral student will combine remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and analyses of empirical ecological datasets to develop and implement monitoring of grassland management and its effects on flowering plant and pollinator diversity at a regional scale.
