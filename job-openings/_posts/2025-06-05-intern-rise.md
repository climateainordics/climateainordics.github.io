RISE Research Institutes of Sweden is offering an internship opportunity at its Lund office as part of a 2-year research project in collaboration with Arla.

Are you interested in ecology, sustainability, and the intersection of AI and biodiversity? We are seeking 1–2 motivated interns to join our applied research team in Fall 2025.

### The Project

The project aims to develop AI-based tools to identify and map biodiversity-relevant landscape elements — such as perennial flower strips, trees, and ponds — on farms using very high-resolution satellite data. These tools will help Arla and its farmers verify and enhance efforts toward sustainable land use and biodiversity preservation.

As part of this, we will collect super high-resolution (SHR) imagery using drones at selected Arla farms. The resulting imagery will be annotated to create training data for the AI models.

### Your Role

You will annotate key landscape features in drone images using an AI-assisted segmentation tool. This involves working on an Ubuntu-based system where you’ll provide minimal input (a few clicks), and the AI will complete detailed segmentation masks.

No prior experience with remote sensing or drone imagery is required — training will be provided on site.

### Requirements

- General knowledge of landscape features and biodiversity (e.g., from ecology, biology, or environmental science)
- Willingness to learn basic technical tools (on Linux/Ubuntu-based systems)
- Attention to detail and consistency in annotations
- Based in or near Lund, with ability to attend the RISE office regularly

### Nice to Have

- Experience with GIS, drone imagery, or image annotation tools (not required)

### Practical Details

- Duration: 2–3 months
- Workload: Part-time (~50%)
- Schedule: Flexible, allowing compatibility with ongoing studies
