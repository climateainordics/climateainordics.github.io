RISE is hiring a junior researcher in machine learning for climate adaptation.

Do you want to use your expertise in AI to help build a greener future? As a junior researcher, you will conduct research in machine learning and initially work on the project “Grey to Green”, where we develop an AI-based tool that helps cities transform grey areas into multifunctional green spaces. The position offers a unique opportunity to grow within a strong professional network of leading researchers across the Nordics, with the possibility of starting PhD studies as part of your work.

Main duties include developing machine learning solutions, writing scientific articles, and collaborating with project partners. We are looking for someone with a Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g., computer science, applied mathematics, remote sensing) and coursework in AI, machine learning, and image analysis. Experience with geospatial data is meriting.

The position is in-person, in Gothenburg, Sweden.
