<span title="I am a lecturer in Urban Planning at the University of Auckland, bringing over 13 years of experience in both research and practice. My focus is on addressing climate change challenges, enhancing urban resilience, promoting regeneration, and advocating for environmental justice. I am particularly interested in understanding and mitigating the risks that urban areas encounter, especially those related to climate change and natural hazards. My research examines how cities can adapt to these increasing threats, emphasising resilience, risk reduction, and sustainable planning to protect communities and infrastructure.

<span title="My research consistently targets the physical mechanisms that enable climate predictability. This includes understanding how tropical dynamics influence atmospheric circulation over the Western Arctic and the North Atlantic-European sector. I have developed an experimental teleconnection-based seasonal prediction system at SMHI, designed to make teleconnections operationally useful for seasonal forecasting. This system exemplifies his ability to translate scientific discoveries into practical tools for climate.  I contribute to making a physically based application of machine learning methods to improve climate predictability, for example, designing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for various applications: 1) downscaling coarse-resolution datasets, 2)detecting extreme events in large datasets, and 3) improving seasonal forecasts. I am a work package leader of two Horizon Europe projects (OptimESM and AI4PEX) in which we leverage ML-based solutions.
