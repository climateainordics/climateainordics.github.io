<span title="I Muhammad Ahmed, belong to a middle-class family living in a backward area. I am the first child in my family who reached and secured the university level. I recently graduated from the University of Agriculture Faisalabad with a degree in agriculture with specialization in plant breeding genetics. Currently, I am doing my master&#x27;s from the same university and also seeking foreign scholarship opportunities. I am currently doing my research on oilseed crop biofortification and genome-wide studies. I have strong expertise in molecular biology, biotechnology, disease diagnostics, breeding, and bioinformatics data analysis. I am currently also working in the Bioinformatics lab and working on plant disease diagnostics transcriptome/RNA sequencing data analysis. I have also expertise in climate studies as I have done many fellowships, courses, trainings, and projects on climate change. My ultimate goal is to address the global food security, climate change, and public health issues.  In my academia, I did internships, worked on research projects, and did jobs related to academia during my vacations. Moreover, I have also been teaching students as a tutor for the last year. Other than academia, I have been socially very active for the last five years. I have been an active member of Rotary International since 2019 as a Rotaractor (Youth Leader). In my university, I worked in different societies and clubs. I served as President of the Rotaract Club of UAF from 2022-23. I also served as Vice President of Quiz Club UAF from 2022-23. Moreover, I have remained an active member of Debating Club UAF for three years. While serving on different designations in different clubs and organizations, I did a lot of community service, youth service, International service, etc., projects and led them effectively. I worked as an event organizer and organized Art and Literature festivals at the national level in my university. I also participated in different quizzes and debate competitions at the national level while representing my home institute and won too. I received many awards and recognitions as well. During my presidency tenure, I received the &quot;Best President of the Month&quot; and &quot;Best Club of the Year&quot; awards at the Rotary International District annual conference.
