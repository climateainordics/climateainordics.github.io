<span title="My research focuses on machine learning for earth observation. Earth system data is among the most unique and abundant multi-modal data, making it an ideal platform for novel machine learning research. My new position offers an opportunity to continue bringing unique and timely challenges of EO to the ML community and remarkable ML methods to the EO community. But I am happy to adorn different hats and move up or down the programming-stack to solve real-world problems.
