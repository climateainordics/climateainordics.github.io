On Saturday, December 6th, we hosted the Workshop on [AI for Climate and Conservation (AICC)](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/aicceurips) at the University of Copenhagen South Campus, as part of the EurIPS 2025 conference.
The turnout and the quality of the work presented were truly inspiring.

We're happy to announce that the video recordings of the invited talks are now [available on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjTlhcIBKn4&list=PL6JkQH3tvn4SPEkEpC8ATiUQXHvB871PX) - check them out!
