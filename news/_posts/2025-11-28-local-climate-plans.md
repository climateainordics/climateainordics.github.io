We are thrilled to announce a major success story born directly from the Climate AI Nordics network! Our partner Klimatkollen has been awarded 3 million SEK from the Swedish Postcode Lottery Foundation (Postkodlotteriets stiftelse).

Through collaborations established within our network, Klimatkollen will partner with ClimateView and the Norwegian research center NORCE. Together, they will deploy "Garbo AI" to analyze and compare climate plans from 150 Swedish municipalities. By utilizing ClimateView’s Transition Elements Framework (TEF), the project aims to standardize how we view local transition efforts and empower citizens to hold local governments accountable.

The analysis will be grounded in the Transition Elements Framework (TEF) provided by fellow network member ClimateView, alongside research from NORCE. This unique collaboration will turn complex documents into comparable data, helping municipalities improve their strategies and giving citizens the tools to monitor progress.
