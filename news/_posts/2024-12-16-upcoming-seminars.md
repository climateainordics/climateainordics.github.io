Climate AI Nordics is thrilled to announce coming seminars in early 2025, featuring researchers who are advancing the field of artificial intelligence addressing climate change. These seminars will explore AI applications for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, in alignment with our mission to foster work that address this pressing challenge.

The first seminar, on January 30, 2025, will feature **Amal Nammouchi**, a PhD candidate at Karlstad University and co-founder of [AfriClimate AI](https://www.africlimate.ai/). Amal‚Äôs work focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) and deep reinforcement learning for transparent and trustworthy decision-making, and multimodal machine learning for climate challenges in energy management. Her talk will explore the role of AI in climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa. It advocates for a collaborative approach to build capacity, develop open-source data repositories, and create context-aware, robust AI-driven climate solutions that are culturally and contextually relevant.

On February 20, 2025, **Abdulhakim Abdi** from Lund University will present his research on the application of AI and machine learning to Earth observation data. Dr. Abdi, a senior researcher at the Centre for Environmental and Climate Science, studies natural ecosystems and their response to environmental change. His seminar will provide insights into how these tools can monitor ecosystems in the current biodiversity crisis.

The series continues on March 6, 2025, with a presentation by **Atakan Aral**, an Assistant Professor at the University of Vienna. Professor Aral specializes in distributed systems, edge computing, and resource allocation, with a focus on the development of AI-driven environmental monitoring systems and their information and energy efficiency. 

On March 13, 2025, **Sherrie Wang**, Assistant Professor at MIT, will share her expertise in using AI to monitor agricultural systems. As the leader of the Earth Intelligence Lab, Dr. Wang focuses on developing computational algorithms to support sustainable development. The seminar will cover how AI can improve agricultural management and mitigate climate change, through vision-language models on Earth observation data and mapping of crop types.

The next seminar, on March 27, 2025, will be delivered by **Mar√≠a J. Molina**, an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland. Professor Molina‚Äôs research applies machine learning tools and numerical modeling systems to critical climate science questions, including the prediction of extreme weather events. Her presentation will delve into uncertainty estimation¬†and machine learning-based Earth system models.

These seminars bring together diverse perspectives on how AI can be used to address the challenges of climate change. Amal Nammouchi and Abdulhakim Abdi will highlight the importance of using AI to build resilience in vulnerable regions, ensuring societies can adapt to the effects of climate change. Sherrie Wang and Mar√≠a J. Molina will showcase AI‚Äôs role in mitigating climate change by improving climate predictions and supporting sustainable practices. Meanwhile, Atakan Aral will emphasize the technological innovations that enable efficient and effective environmental monitoring. Our seminars together provide a platform for researchers, policymakers, and the public to engage with cutting-edge research and contribute to the global effort against climate change. The seminars are organized in collaboration with [RISE](https://ri.se/lm-sem/).

Stay tuned for further updates on each seminar. Join us if your are working on how AI can help us navigate one of humanity‚Äôs greatest challenges.
