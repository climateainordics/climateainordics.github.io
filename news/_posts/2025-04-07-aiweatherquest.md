**Call for Climate AI Nordics to apply our expertise to a global forecasting competition: join the ECMWF AI Weather Quest** 

The **ECMWF AI Weather Quest**, a global machine learning competition led by the **European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)** and endorsed by the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**, is now open. It challenges participants to develop **AI-driven probabilistic forecasts** for the **sub-seasonal range** â€” specifically for **days 19â€“25 and 26â€“31 ahead**, a critical window for early warning and operational climate decisions. 

**ECMWF is especially eager to see participation from the Climate AI Nordics community, which is at the forefront of using AI to tackle climate challenges.** The AI Weather Quest is a unique opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge forecasting research while connecting with a global network of scientists and practitioners.  

**What participants will forecast** 

Teams are invited to submit **probabilistic weekly forecasts** for: 

* **Near-surface air temperature**   
* **Precipitation**   
* **Mean sea level pressure** 

Forecasts may target one or both lead times: 

* **Days 19â€“25**   
* **Days 26â€“31** 

Participants can work with **any dataset**, use **any programming language**, and apply **any AI/ML methodology**. Forecasts are **self-evaluated** using ECMWFâ€™s tools before the competitive scoring phase begins later in the year. 

**Competition timeline** 

**Initial Training Phase (Marchâ€“August 2025):** Participants explore datasets, tools, and evaluation methods. The **Testing JJA Period (Juneâ€“August)** allows teams to submit forecasts and self-evaluate performance in a non-competitive setting. 

**Competitive Phase (from September 2025):** Teams submit real-time forecasts that will be scored and ranked using ECMWFâ€™s evaluation framework. Public results will showcase the top-performing approaches. 

**How to get involved** 

The competition is open to individuals and teams from research institutions, private companies, and public bodies. To help participants prepare, ECMWF is hosting two **technical webinars on 7 May 2025** that will explain how to participate in the Testing Period: 

* [08:00â€“09:00 UTC â€“ Register here](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/469/)   
* [14:00â€“15:00 UTC â€“ Register here](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/470/)
