With [EurIPS 2025 in Copenhagen](https://eurips.cc) just around the corner, below is a summary of Climate AI Nordics-related activities at the conference - hope to see you in several of these!

**Tuesday Dec 2nd:** Researchers from Climate AI Nordics will present work in at least two [ELLIS UnConference](https://eurips.cc/ellis/) workshops: **(1)** [AI for Earth and Climate Sciences](https://www.ellis-jena.eu/ellis-unconference-2025/), and **(2)** [Energy-Efficient AI: Models, Algorithms, and Hardware for Sustainable Intelligence](https://ellis-unit-graz.github.io/workshops/).

**Wednesday Dec 3rd - Friday Dec 5th:** During the [main conference days](https://eurips.cc/conference/), Climate AI Nordics will be part of a booth - shared with [Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aicentre.dk/) and [Nordic AIR](https://www.nordicpartnership.ai/) - where you can come by to learn more about the network. We'll also arrange a **dedicated event on Thu Dec 4th at 15:00-16:00**, which _includes the traditional Scandinavian xmas beverage glögg/gløgg!_

**Friday Dec 5th:** Climate AI Nordics organizes an [after work social](https://eurips.cc/events/) at 18:00.

**Saturday Dec 6th:** The day of [AICC: Workshop on AI for Climate and Conservation](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/aicceurips), organized by Climate AI Nordics! Furthermore, researchers from Climate AI Nordics will present work at the workshop [Rethinking AI: Efficiency, Frugality, and Sustainability](https://rethinking-ai.github.io/).

**Sunday Dec 7th:** Researchers from Climate AI Nordics will be part of organizing as well as presenting work at the workshop [REO: Advances in Representation Learning for Earth Observation](https://sites.google.com/view/reoeurips).
