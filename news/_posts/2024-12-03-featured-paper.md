abstract: "Africa, as a major climate change hotspot, faces
severe impacts, including extreme temperatures. Notably, urban areas
are unequally affected by these impacts. The urban poor are
particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures, because of
the environmental and physical characteristics of their
neighbourhoods, and their limited resources to develop coping
strategies. Limited knowledge exists of the spatial patterns
of thermal inequalities within neighbourhoods. Our overall
scientific objective is to explore the potential of Earth
Observation (EO) to study how and why urban dwellers in the
Global South (focusing on Africa) with different levels of
deprivation are divergently exposed to varying temperatures and
extreme heat, and to quantify the urban population exposed
to such conditions. We make use of several state-of-the-art
EO/AI models, and employ innovative in situ data collection
methods together with local stakeholders through Citizen Science.
We rely as far as possible on open or low-cost satellite
imagery (e.g., Sentinel-1/2, Landsat, ECOSTRESS) for scalability
and transferability, and we implement Machine Learning (ML) methods, including Deep Learning (DL). Results
highlight significant local differences in thermal exposure,
emphasizing the need to understand and communicate these
spatial patterns to support the development of cost-effective
adaptation strategies."

The new Climate Change AI Nordics Featured Paper is "ONEKANA: Modelling Thermal Inequalities in African Cities" by Sabine Vanhuysse and colleagues. This research addresses the pressing issue of thermal disparities in rapidly urbanizing African cities, where vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by extreme heat due to environmental and socioeconomic factors.

The paper combines Earth Observation (EO) data, Machine Learning (ML), and Citizen Science to model near-surface air temperatures at a spatial resolution of 100m x 100m. By integrating satellite imagery with in situ temperature measurements, the paper provides detailed insights into how different urban areas experience varying thermal exposures. Target data comes from fixed sparse sensors, and crowd-sourced mobile measurements by citizens. The approach sheds light on urban heat distribution and may empower local communities to participate actively in data collection and climate adaptation strategies.

The findings underscore significant local differences in thermal exposure, emphasizing the necessity for targeted, cost-effective adaptation measures to protect the most affected urban populations. This work exemplifies the potential of combining AI-based tools with community engagement to address climate challenges in vulnerable regions.
