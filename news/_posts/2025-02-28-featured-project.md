At the island of Stora Karlsö, close to Gotland in Sweden, there is an artificial rock shelf -- called AukLab -- with enough space to host hundreds of breeding birds. The base of this platform rests in the middle of an established Common Guillemot colony, and allows researchers to study the birds from just a few centimeters away. The AukLab artificial rock shelf was built thanks to funding from WWF Sweden, and its purpose is to enable detailed studies without disturbing the birds -- similar to a bird hide, but hanging outside the cliff edge.

Through AI-based camera surveillance, every aspect of the birds' life on land is meticulously documented -- from their return to the cliff ledge after winter to lay eggs and raise chicks, to their departure in mid-summer. Additional measurement sensors, such as thermometers, weight scales, and thermal cameras, provide further insights into what we observe happening in the birds' hectic lives.

Seabirds are near the top of their food web, and changes in their habitat are reflected in their behaviour. Climate change, overfishing, eutrophication and toxic emissions are all examples of human impact on the environment that can negatively affect the life of Baltic seabirds in different ways. By studying changes in the birds’ behaviour, one can get an idea of what is occurring beneath the water’s surface. Much like the canary in the mine, the seabirds act as “messengers” of environmental change and overall health. When combined with other research projects, seabird research can provide greater insight into the Baltic Sea ecosystem, and thereby inform decisions regarding best environmental management practices.

Near-term future work includes adding additional sensors to further improve the monitoring of the guillemot. In particular, acoustic monitoring techniques will complement the current vision-based sensors. The hope is for this additional data modality to provide even more fine-grained insights about the lives of the Guillemots. By leveraging multiple sensors and advanced AI analysis, researchers are able to paint a fuller picture about the environment around the birds, to understand more fully how different stressors change their lives.
