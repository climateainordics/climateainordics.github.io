🔴 We’re Live!

As Climate AI Nordics just celebrated its first anniversary, we are now thrilled to announce the launch of our official YouTube channel!

This past year has been [filled with incredible milestones](/news/2025-10-24-cain-1year/), from our first annual workshop to a diverse [series of expert webinars](/events/). Now, we are making these resources accessible to everyone. Whether you are a researcher, a practitioner, or simply an enthusiast, our new channel is your hub for the latest discussions at the intersection of AI, climate, and conservation.

## 🎥 Now Streaming: The Nordic Workshop on AI for Climate Change

Did you miss our first annual workshop in Gothenburg on May 13, 2025? Or perhaps you want to revisit a specific presentation?

We have released the recordings from this full-day event, co-arranged with our partners at [CLIMES](https://climes.se/). You can now watch leading researchers from across the region discuss how AI is revolutionizing fields such as: biodiversity monitoring, atmospheric chemistry, soundscape analysis, and Earth observation.

## 🧠 An amazing collection of webinars

Beyond the workshop, our channel already features a rich archive of our webinars. These sessions have served as a meeting place for deep dives into specific technical challenges and solutions in the intersection of AI and climate action.

Explore talks from the past year, including:

* Peter Dueben (ECMWF) on the shift from physics-based forecasts to foundation models in Earth system modelling.
* Lily Xu (Columbia University) on real-world AI deployment for wildlife protection using reinforcement learning.
* Joel Oskarsson (Linköping University) on graph-based approaches to weather prediction.
* Benjamin Cretois (NINA) on using acoustic sensors for large-scale biodiversity monitoring.
* Sigrid Passano Hellan (NORCE/Bjerknes Centre) on making ML more accessible through Bayesian optimisation.

    ...and many more contributions from experts at King's College London, University of Florida, [AfriClimate AI](https://africlimate.ai/), RISE, ETH Zurich, MIT, Lund University, and many more.

This YouTube channel is just one more way we are connecting the Nordic AI/Climate community. As we look forward to the upcoming AICC workshop at EurIPS 2025 in Copenhagen, we invite you to subscribe, watch, and share these resources.
