The first annual Nordic Workshop on AI for Climate Change concluded in Gothenburg on May 13, marking a significant and successful milestone for research on AI for climate action in the Nordic countries. The event was a vibrant convergence of leading researchers, practitioners, and innovators, all united by their work at the critical intersection of artificial intelligence and climate action. Throughout the day, the venue was alive with conversations and focused engagement. Computer vision specialists could be seen in discussion with marine biologists, while atmospheric chemists and soundscape analysis researchers shared perspectives around poster displays. Ideas found common ground.

Attendees explored a wide array of impactful topics, from harnessing citizen science and AI for more accurate species range estimation to deploying soundscape analysis and bioacoustic event detection for enhanced biodiversity monitoring. Discussions also delved into the crucial environmental footprint of AI itself, particularly within environmental monitoring, and showcased AI's growing role in understanding atmospheric chemistry. The power of Large Language Models to extract critical insights from climate-related texts and to evaluate the reliability of specialized language models was another key theme. Furthermore, the workshop highlighted how AI, combined with Earth observation data, is revolutionizing our ability to scale up complex tasks such as detailed tree cover mapping and insightful socio-economic analyses in our rapidly changing climate.

We are immensely grateful to all the incredible speakers whose presentations sparked such engaging dialogue, and to every participant who contributed to the workshop's dynamic and collaborative atmosphere. Our sincere thanks go to our partner network, [Climes - Swedish centre for impacts of climate extremes](https://climes.se/), for their invaluable co-arrangement of the event. The keynote talks and oral presentations were amazing, setting a high bar for future events.

Building on this fantastic momentum, we are thrilled to announce that the 2026 Nordic Workshop on AI for Climate Change will be hosted by our core team members at the University of Copenhagen and the Pioneer Centre for AI, on June 26, 2026. Keep an eye out for more information on this and other community events!

We are immensely proud to be building this vital community. The success of our inaugural workshop is a testament to the collective passion and expertise in the Nordic region. Letâ€™s continue to connect, collaborate, and tirelessly work towards maximizing the important potential of AI to address the urgent climate crisis facing our planet.
