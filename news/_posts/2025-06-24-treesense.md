### About the TreeSense Center

The **Center for Remote Sensing and Deep Learning of Global Tree Resources (TreeSense)** is a new Danish National Research Foundation *Center of Excellence* that aims to revolutionize how we observe and understand woody vegetation worldwide — inside and beyond forests.

The center will develop AI-based algorithms for next-generation satellite data to enable:

- Detection and characterization of individual trees  
- Estimation of height, crown size, species, and carbon stocks  
- Mapping of usage patterns and local livelihoods  
- Monitoring of environmental and anthropogenic pressures on tree resources

By integrating advanced remote sensing with deep learning, TreeSense will generate vital insights into the ecological and human factors shaping tree resources — and their implications for ecosystems and livelihoods.

The center is funded with a grant of **DKK 59,909,600** and officially began its operations in spring 2025.

**Leadership Team:**
- **Professor Rasmus Fensholt** (UCPH-IGN), Center Leader  
- **Professor Christian Igel** (UCPH-DIKU), Co-PI  
- **Assoc. Prof. Laura Vang Rasmussen** (UCPH-IGN), Co-PI  
- **Assoc. Prof. Martin Brandt** (UCPH-IGN), Co-PI  
- **Asst. Prof. Ankit Kariryaa** (UCPH-DIKU/IGN), Co-PI  
- **Andreas Egelund Christensen** (UCPH-IGN), Center Administrator
