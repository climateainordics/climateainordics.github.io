Just before summer, the Norwegian government and the Research Council of Norway announced a major boost for AI research: six new national AI research centers, each receiving up to NOK 200 million over five years.
The centers will explore the societal impact of AI, advance the technology itself, and strengthen innovation in both the public and private sectors.

While the main focus areas include human–AI learning, trustworthy AI, creativity, robotics, ethics, and decision support, several centers integrate sustainability and environmental responsibility — from studying AI’s energy footprint to enabling greener industries.

Over the next 6–12 months, many PhD positions will open on topics relevant to climate, environment, and the green transition.

The centers will be introduced at a public online event on **August 26, 2025**, with leaders presenting their visions and research priorities.

**The new AI research centers:**
- **Empowerment of Human Learning** (UiB, NTNU, UiO, and partners) – Hybrid human–AI learning for education, work, and society.
- **The Norwegian Centre for Trustworthy AI** (UiO, Norsk Regnesentral, SINTEF, and partners) – Fair, transparent, and responsible AI.
- **Center for AI & Creativity** (UiO, UiA, and partners) – AI’s role in creative industries, culture, and regulation.
- **Norwegian Centre for Embodied AI** (NTNU, OsloMet, UiT, and partners) – Robotics with generalisable, embedded AI.
- **Norwegian Centre for Sustainable, Risk-averse and Ethical AI** (Simula, BI, UiO, NTNU, UiT, CICERO, and partners) – Sustainable, ethical AI for climate, energy, and industry.
- **Norwegian Centre on AI-decisions** (SINTEF, NTNU, SimulaMET, and partners) – AI-powered decision-making for energy, health, logistics, and industry.

This event is not organized by or affiliated with Climate AI Nordics.
