## Short Gothenburg Guide

The 2025 Nordic Workshop on AI for Climate Change is getting close. Here are some tips about Gothenburg.

### How to get around

* The venue is *Lindholmen Science Park* and can be reached by free ferry rides from the eastern side of the river, Göta Älv. You can also take bus 16, X1, or 21 from Central Station (bus stop "*Nordstan*") to bus stop "*Lindholmen*".
* Trams, buses, boats, and trains: Use [Västtrafik](https://www.vasttrafik.se/). A 90-minute ticket costs SEK 37, a 3 day ticket costs SEK 240. Zone "A" will take you to most places inside Gothenburg and some of its suburbs. Easiest is to buy tickets in the ["Västtrafik To Go"](https://www.vasttrafik.se/biljetter/mer-om-biljetter/vasttrafik-to-go/) app, available for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/vasttrafik-to-go/id424903083?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vaesttrafik.vaesttrafik&hl=sv).
* Bicycle: You can rent bicycles from [Styr och ställ](https://styrochstall.se/sv/faq/), [Voi](https://www.voi.com/sv/stad/gothenburg), [Tier-Dott](https://ridedott.com/sv/), and [Ryde](https://www.ryde-technology.com/) - All these require you to download an app and register before renting. The latter three also rents out electric scooters, which have to be parked in designated places.
* Taxi: There are a number of different old-school taxi companies in the town. [Taxi Göteborg](https://www.taxigoteborg.se/) and [Taxi Kurir](https://www.taxikurir.se/goteborg) are two examples. You can also book taxis though Uber and Bolt.
* Airport bus: [Flygbussarna](https://www.flygbussarna.se/landvetter). Special tickets required.

### Things to do

    * Take a ferry to the **archipelago**: Take the tram to [Saltholmen](https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/hallplatser/9021014005630000/), and then change to the ferry to Brännö, Asperö, Styrsö, Vargö, or Donsö.
