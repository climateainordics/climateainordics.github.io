**10:00 Oral: Edmond Sacre,** Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/sacre.jpg)

**Title**: Mapping and conservation of aquatic species - potential advances with deep learning

**Abstract**: In the field of conservation planning, a great deal of effort and research has gone into the spatial modelling (i.e. mapping) of species, habitats, and other ecological processes. These models and data are a crucial component of conservation decision making, such as where to place protected areas and where to focus habitat restoration efforts. However, producing such maps is often challenging where data are limited. This is particularly true in aquatic environments, which are inherently more difficult to sample and remotely observe. To date, species distribution models have typically employed traditional statistical or machine learning techniques. There exists, therefore, great potential to improve these methods using more advance deep learning methods, which could lead to great improvements in map accuracy and, therefore, better conservation decisions. These powerful methods could also be used not only to produce maps of species distributions today, but also to predict where species may occur in the future under different climate scenarios, and where they might have occurred in the past.

*E. Sacre is a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) within the Department of Aquatic Resources (SLU Aqua). He obtained his PhD in 2019 at James Cook University, Australia, within the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Studies. At SLU Aqua, Edmond works within the Unit for Conservation and Marine Spatial Planning where he has been employed since 2019. He is involved in a variety of national and international projects focused on species distribution modeling, spatial conservation planning, cumulative impact assessment, and connectivity modeling. These projects include Protect Baltic (EU-Horizon), Western Indian Ocean Symphony (Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management), and other national mapping projects.*

<a name="dan"></a>
**11:10 Oral: Dan Stowell,** Tilburg University

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/stowell.jpg)

**Title**: Bioacoustic AI for nature: how can it tread lightly?

**Abstract**: The biodiversity crisis is deeply entwined with the climate crisis. Worse, we only know part of the picture of biodiversity: less than one-quarter of the world's species have even been described, let alone monitored. The monitoring task is so large that it necessitates automation: AI can help. I will introduce some of the latest work in bioacoustic AI, for sensing the sounds of wildlife. But this leads to a follow-on question: is it even possible to roll out AI sensing at massive scale, without imposing a heavy burden of carbon emissions and e-waste? I will discuss these risks, and then I will compare the environmental costs and benefits of the tools in our bioacoustic toolbox.

*Dan Stowell is an Associate Professor of AI & Biodiversity working in the Netherlands (Tilburg University, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre, JADS). His research is about machine listening and computational bioacoustics - which means using computation (especially machine learning) to understand animal sounds and other sound signals.*

*- I develop automatic processes to analyse large amounts of sound
recordings - for example detecting the bird sounds in there and how they vary, how they relate to each other, how the birds' behaviour relates to the sounds they make. The research work is focussed on the machine learning and signal processing methods that can help with these questions. I also work with others to apply these methods to biodiversity monitoring.*

*Dan also works with OpenClimateFix and OpenStreetMap on addressing climate change through solar panel mapping.*

**11:40 Oral: John Martinsson,** RISE Research Institutes of Sweden: *Understanding the World Through Sound: Enhancing Biodiversity Monitoring*

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/martinsson.webp)

**Title**: Better Labels, Better AI: Enhancing Bioacoustic Event Detection for Biodiversity Monitoring

**Abstract**: Robust bioacoustic monitoring is essential for biodiversity research, providing valuable insights into species presence, behavior, and ecosystem health. AI-driven approaches have the potential to scale these efforts, but their effectiveness critically depends on the quality of labeled data. However, manual annotation of animal vocalizations is often time-consuming, costly, and prone to inconsistencies. In this talk, I will present novel active labeling methods for audio that focus on streamlining annotation workflows and enhancing label quality to strengthen bioacoustic event detection performance. In addition, I will share early insights from an ongoing bioacoustics collaboration, where we are analyzing audio recordings from a Guillemot colony at Stora Karlsö. This case study highlights both the challenges and opportunities in improving AI-based bioacoustics monitoring, ultimately contributing to more reliable and scalable conservation efforts in Nordic environments.

*John Martinsson is a researcher specializing in machine listening-using machine learning to analyze audio data-and its application to bioacoustics and biodiversity monitoring. A key focus of his research is on streamlining the often labor-intensive process of labeling bioacoustic data, and on creating robust models that perform effectively even with limited labeled data.

<a name="christian"></a>
**13:15 Keynote: Christian Igel,** University of Copenhagen

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/igel.jpg)

**Title**: Deep learning for large-scale ecosystem monitoring

**Abstract**: Tree-based ecosystems play an important role for carbon sequestration and biodiversity as well as for timber and food production. We need a better characterization of woody resources at a global scale to understand how these ecosystems are affected by climate change and human management. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning (ML) based computer vision make this possible. Deep learning applied to high-resolution satellite imagery allows, for example, for large-scale mapping of individual trees. The biomass of each tree, and thereby its carbon content, can then be estimated from the crown size using allometric equations learned from data. The functional relation is assumed to be non-decreasing, and incorporating this constraint into ML-based modelling increase the scientific plausibility and acts as a strong regularizer. We highlight an application of tree carbon stock quantification in Rwanda, where it helps developing pathways to reach the country’s sustainable development goals. The talk closes with a presentation of recently released open source image data sets for training ML models for different environmental monitoring tasks.

*Christian Igel is a professor at DIKU, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. He is the director of the SCIENCE AI Centre. Furthermore, he is a co-lead of the Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence, Denmark and a Fellow of ELLIS, European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems. Christian's reserach interests include support vector machines and other kernel-based methods,evolution strategies for single- and multi-objective optimization and reinforcement learning, PAC-Bayesian analysis of ensemble methods, deep neural networks and stochastic neural networks, and applications of machine learning that help achieve the sustainable development goals.*

<a name="stefanos"></a>
**14:20 Oral: Stefanos Georganos,** Karlstad University: Unequal Cities in a Changing Climate: AI and Geospatial Approaches to Urban Resilience

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/georganos.jpg)

**Title**: Unequal Cities in a Changing Climate: AI and Geospatial Approaches to Urban Resilience

**Abstract**: Cities in the Global South face mounting challenges from rapid urbanization and climate change, with millions residing in deprived areas or so-called ‘slums.’ This presentation explores how AI-driven geospatial techniques—leveraging Earth Observation (EO) and GIS data—can enhance the mapping and understanding of urban vulnerability and deprivation. By integrating EO data with automated approaches, these methods reveal spatial inequalities that are often exacerbated by climate change and overlooked by traditional surveys and censuses. The insights gained support equitable resource allocation and inform policy interventions aimed at fostering more resilient and sustainable urban futures for some of the most vulnerable communities.

*Stefanos Georganos is an Associate Professor in Geomatics at Karlstad University. He does research in quantitative human geography, remote sensing, spatial epidemiology, demography and machine learning. He is particularly interested in the use of geo-information for helping address the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a geographical interest in sub-Saharan African cities. His latest research unravels the potential of machine and deep learnning and Earth Observation to detect, measure and characterize socio-economic inequalities in deprived urban areas in support of the most vulnerable populations.*

**15:10 Oral: Alouette van Hove,** University of Oslo

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/van-hove.jpg)

**Title**: Navigating methane plumes: A journey from drone observations to flux estimates

**Abstract**: Accurate regional mapping of methane emissions remains a challenge in climate science, contributing to uncertainties in national emission inventories and climate change projections. To address this issue, we have developed a novel observing system that assimilates drone observations into an atmospheric dispersion model to estimate methane emission rates effectively. In this presentation, we will discuss the application of our Bayesian framework to evaluate methane emissions from various livestock herds in Kenya. Additionally, our ongoing system development focuses on optimizing drone sampling paths to collect the most informative data, even in unfamiliar environments. Through synthetic experiments, we investigate how reinforcement learning can improve sampling strategies, enabling drones to efficiently acquire data and infer more accurate methane emission rate estimates.

*Alouette van Hove is a PhD candidate at the University of Oslo. Her research interests includes the development of a novel framework to estimate land surface fluxes at a regional scale. The framework makes use of sensor measurements from drones, data assimilation, atmospheric fluid dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to deliver high-resolution surface maps of greenhouse gas fluxes in northern landscapes for validation of climate models.*

**15:30 Oral: Shorouq Zahra,** RISE Research Institutes of Sweden

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/zahra.jpg)

**Title**: The challenges of using LLMs to extract data on extreme climate events

**Abstract**: Large volumes of data on extreme climate impacts are buried in copious amounts of text, such as in Wikipedia articles. Such data is essential for climate change research as well as for building downstream applications like climate impact forecasting or early warning systems. Even though a number of manually-created extreme climate event databases exist, they may (a) be skewed towards under-reporting impacts in certain regions or languages; (b) require extensive manual labor to produce, update and quality-check; and (c) possibly limit the potential hazard impact analyses due to lacking uniformity or using different categorization schemes. This presentation will walk you through the successes and challenges faced when building and testing an LLM-based extraction pipeline for climate-related texts that attempts to address some of these shortcomings. The final product, Wikimpacts v1.0, presents a large-scale database of extreme climate impacts (caused by, for example, floods, droughts, or tornadoes) in terms of both human cost and material loss.

*Shorouq Zahra a research engineer and developer at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, with a focus on NLP, conversational AI, and MLOps. She has been engaged in the work "Using LLMs to Build a Database of Climate Extreme Impacts", presented at ClimateNLP 2024, proposing a method for building large-scale databases of climate extreme impacts from online textual sources, using LLMs for information extraction in combination with more traditional NLP techniques to improve accuracy and consistency.*

**15:50 Oral: David Thulke,** RWTH Aachen University

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/thulke.jpg)

**Title**: Assessing and Improving ClimateGPT's Faithfulness in Retrieval Augmented Generation

**Abstract**: Large language models utilising retrieval augmented generation have the potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible. While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether the model’s output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we explore approaches to automatically assess the faithfulness of different models in this setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in climate science, to examine which factors in instruction fine-tuning impact the model's faithfulness.

*David Thulke is a PhD student within the Human Language Technology Group at the Chair of Computer Science 6 of the RWTH Aachen University supervised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Hermann Ney. In addition to numerous other works on language models and retrieval augmented generation, he is the first author of ClimateGPT, a model family of domain-specific large language models for information retrieval and generation. He also works as a language processing scientist at AppTek.*
