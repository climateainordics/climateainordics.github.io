At SLU Aqua, Edmond works within the Unit for Conservation and Marine Spatial Planning where he has been employed since 2019. He is involved in a variety of national and international projects focused on species distribution modeling, spatial conservation planning, cumulative impact assessment, and connectivity modeling. These projects include Protect Baltic (EU-Horizon), Western Indian Ocean Symphony (Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management), and other national mapping projects.*

**10:20 Oral: Amal Nammouchi,** Karlstad University and AfriClimate AI

**11:10 Oral: Dan Stowell,** Tilburg University

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/stowell.jpg)

*Dan Stowell is an Associate Professor of AI & Biodiversity working in the Netherlands (Tilburg University, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre, JADS). His research is about machine listening and computational bioacoustics - which means using computation (especially machine learning) to understand animal sounds and other sound signals.*

*- I develop automatic processes to analyse large amounts of sound
recordings - for example detecting the bird sounds in there and how they vary, how they relate to each other, how the birds' behaviour relates to the sounds they make. The research work is focussed on the machine learning and signal processing methods that can help with these questions. I also work with others to apply these methods to biodiversity monitoring.*

*Dan also works with OpenClimateFix and OpenStreetMap on addressing climate change through solar panel mapping.*

**11:40 Oral: John Martinsson,** RISE Research Institutes of Sweden: *Understanding the World Through Sound: Enhancing Biodiversity Monitoring*

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/martinsson.webp)

*John Martinsson is a researcher specializing in machine listening-using machine learning to analyze audio data-and its application to bioacoustics and biodiversity monitoring. A key focus of his research is on streamlining the often labor-intensive process of labeling bioacoustic data, and on creating robust models that perform effectively even with limited labeled data.

*Alouette van Hove is a PhD candidate at the University of Oslo. Her research interests includes the development of a novel framework to estimate land surface fluxes at a regional scale. The framework makes use of sensor measurements from drones, data assimilation, atmospheric fluid dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to deliver high-resolution surface maps of greenhouse gas fluxes in northern landscapes for validation of climate models.*
