[(See full schedule here)](schedule).

### Session chair duties

* Be available before the session starts (~10 minutes) for helping speakers with microphones and other things.
* Read up on the speaker biographies in your session before the workshop.
* Be able to introduce the speakers briefly (30-60 seconds)
    - Note that there is no time allocated for introductions, but the introduction for next speaker should preferably be done before the timer goes to  0.
* Prepare a couple of questions to ask each speaker after their talks, if there are no questions from the audience.
* Help the helper find who in the audience wants the microphone.
* There are two speaker (clip-on) microphones. Make sure that the next speaker always has one of them! Session chair should use the hand-held microphone.
* Assist the speakers if they have questions.

### Tech

* There is a hdmi connection. Presenters use their own computers (but there is one available to borrow).
* There are two clip-on microphones, and one hand-held microphone. The clip-ons will be for speakers, and the hand-held for chairs and audience.
* There will be one screen showing the number of minutes left in each speaker slot.
    - When this goes to 0, it shows 5 more minutes in red, for the Q&A session.
    - If you press 'd', you get to enter a delay if we need the timer to back off a bit.
* There is a camera which does not have an operator. It records all the talks. Important to use the microphnes so that sound is recorded.

### Oral presentations

* Regular oral presentation slots are 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions and setup. For details, see the [schedule](schedule.html).
* A timer on stage will count down the minutes for their talk, and then the minues remaining for their QA session. If this fails, we should show papers with 5 minutes and 1 minute warnings.
* Each presenter are expected to make sure the presentation is loaded on a working computer by the start of their session. There will be a laptop available that can be borrowed for presentations. Talk to the session chair if you need to borrow the computer.
