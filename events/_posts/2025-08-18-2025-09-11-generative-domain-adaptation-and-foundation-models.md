title: "Generative domain adaptation and foundation models for robust Earth observation"
summary: "Webinar with Georges Le Bellier, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers.
Deep learning for remote sensing is key to turning satellite and aerial imagery into real-world insights, but models must handle diverse sensors, environments, and conditions such as clouds and seasonal changes. The talk explores two approaches to building more robust algorithms: generative domain adaptation and geospatial foundation models. FlowEO will be presented as a generative method for unsupervised domain adaptation with high predictive accuracy across tasks, including post-disaster response and SAR-to-optical translation, without retraining the base model. The webinar will also cover PANGAEA, an evaluation protocol for geospatial foundation models that covers several datasets, modalities, and temporalities, comparing them with supervised baselines. PANGAEA highlights the strengths and weaknesses of GFMs, especially under limited annotations, and examines the role of multi-temporal data."

However, Earth observation models must handle diverse environments, sensors, and conditions—such as clouds, seasonal shifts, and geographic differences—while still producing accurate results. In this talk, we explore two paths that lead to more robust and adaptable algorithms: generative domain adaptation and geospatial foundation models.

First, I will introduce FlowEO, a generative approach of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Earth observation, and show its high performance in UDA scenarios for several downstream tasks, including dense prediction and classification. This flow-matching-based translation method improves pretrained predictive models&#x27; accuracies in challenging scenarios such as post-disaster response and high cloud coverage cases with SAR-to-optical translation. FlowEO’s generative domain adaptation method is independent of the downstream task and does not require retraining the predictive model.

Then, I will present “PANGAEA: A Global and Inclusive Benchmark for Geospatial Foundation Models“, a standardized evaluation protocol that covers a diverse set of datasets, dense prediction tasks, resolutions, sensor modalities, and temporalities. This benchmark includes comparison between geospatial foundation models but also with supervised baselines, namely U-Net and ViT, and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of GFMs. In addition, PANGAEA evaluates models’ accuracy in cases where labels are limited and questions the impact of multi-temporal data for GFMs."

**Title:** Generative domain adaptation and foundation models for robust Earth observation

**Speaker:** Georges Le Bellier, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers

**Abstract:** Deep learning for remote sensing plays a crucial role in turning satellite and aerial imagery into dependable, real-world insights. However, Earth observation models must handle diverse environments, sensors, and conditions—such as clouds, seasonal shifts, and geographic differences—while still producing accurate results.

**About the speaker:** Georges Le Bellier is a third-year PhD candidate at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, where he researches generative models for Earth Observation. Previously, he explored generative approaches for controllable musical performance at Sony and IRCAM. He now focuses on developing efficient conditional generative models tailored to remote sensing. His current research combines flow-based methods with domain adaptation, aiming to enhance the robustness of EO models to shifting data distributions.
