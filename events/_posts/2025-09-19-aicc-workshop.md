Climate AI Nordics is excited to announce that the [Workshop on AI for Climate and Conservation (AICC)](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/aicceurips) has been accepted for
[EurIPS 2025](https://eurips.cc/workshops/)! The AICC workshop will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark, Dec 6th or 7th (TBD; workshops are co-located with EurIPS)!

_**Call for Participation**_ is open at the [AICC webpage](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/aicceurips)!

## Background

The climate crisis is one of the most pressing challenges facing our societies. While mitigating further climate change remains crucial — e.g. through the conservation of natural carbon stocks
and biodiversity hot spots — the adaptation to new climate conditions with increased risks of flooding, heat waves, and wildfires is becoming inevitable. Machine learning (ML) promises advanced
analytical tools to better understand climate processes and to monitor biodiversity and vegetation health. 

The focus of the AICC workshop will be on identifying open problems in the domain of Climate and Conservation, but also on hearing success stories, where artificial intelligence (AI) made
a positive impact on our planet. Hence, this workshop aims to bring domain experts alongside ML experts to discuss open challenges in their work and to inspire the ML audience to contribute
to these urgent challenges.

**The following questions will guide the program of the AICC workshop:**

_What are the open problems in climate and conservation? (for modellers, practitioners)_

_What is actually needed from AI researchers?_

_How can AI researchers contribute and help practitioners make better decisions?_

_How can AI help to make better decisions?_
