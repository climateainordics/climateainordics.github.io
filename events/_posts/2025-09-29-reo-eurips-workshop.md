The REO workshop will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark, Dec 6th or 7th (TBD; workshops are co-located with EurIPS)!

_**Call for Participation**_ is open at the [REO webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/reoeurips) (Submission deadline Oct. 15)!

## Background
The Representation Learning for Earth Observation (REO) workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from machine learning, computer vision, and Earth sciences to advance the development of robust, interpretable, and scalable models for monitoring our planet. With the growing availability of large-scale, multimodal Earth observation (EO) data and the rise of general-purpose foundation models, new opportunities and challenges emerge for integrating data-driven approaches across sensing modalities and application domains. REO will provide a forum for presenting novel technical methods, scientific applications, and system-level innovations, fostering cross-disciplinary exchange and collaborations between academia, industry, and policy stakeholders.

Due to EO's huge potential to tackle pressing societal challenges, there has also been a growing interest from the machine learning and computer vision community in recent years. The development of representation learning approaches within the EO domain has gained interest and momentum beyond academia. Notable recent examples include Google DeepMind’s AlphaEarth, IBM’s Terramind, AllenAI’s Earth System, and Meta’s DINOv3. 

This growing interest calls for increased community exchange around the development, deployment, and the practical use of these models. This workshop aims to discuss the following :

* Where are we, and how can we move forward as a community?
* What are the open challenges in learning representations of EO data?
* In the era of general-purpose one-for-all models, what is the role of specialized approaches?
