As extreme events following climate change are getting ever more frequent, humanity needs to tackle the new reality on a changing planet on many fronts. Many of the approaches which are in use or under development can be strengthened using advanced analytics tools and optimization techniques. The 2025 Nordic Workshop on AI for Climate Change will gather researchers from the Nordics. This one-day, in-person workshop, will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden, May 13th 2025. The workshop will feature a mix of keynotes, oral presentations, and posters around the topics of AI for climate change, including AI for biodiversity and the green transition. The workshop will be a meeting point for a wide range of researchers from (primarily) around the Nordic countries, but other interested people will be welcome too.

Together, we will help the Nordic AI community to find the most impactful directions of future research in the field.

## Oral presentations

**Dan Stowell,** Tilburg University

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/stowell.jpg)

*Dan Stowell is an Associate Professor of AI & Biodiversity working in the Netherlands (Tilburg University, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre, JADS). His research is about machine listening and computational bioacoustics - which means using computation (especially machine learning) to understand animal sounds and other sound signals.*

*- I develop automatic processes to analyse large amounts of sound
recordings - for example detecting the bird sounds in there and how they vary, how they relate to each other, how the birds' behaviour relates to the sounds they make. The research work is focussed on the machine learning and signal processing methods that can help with these questions. I also work with others to apply these methods to biodiversity monitoring.*

*Dan is a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute, working with OpenClimateFix and OpenStreetMap on addressing climate change through solar panel mapping.*
