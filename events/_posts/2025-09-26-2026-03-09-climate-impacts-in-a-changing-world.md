Abstract submission will open on **29 September 2025** for the international conference **Climate Impacts in a Changing World 2026**, scheduled for **March 9–11, 2026**, in Uppsala, Sweden.

This event aims to foster an interdisciplinary dialogue on the wide-ranging impacts of climate extremes on both human and natural systems. By bringing together researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, the conference seeks to advance integrated approaches for addressing climate impacts and building a just, sustainable future.

We welcome submissions that explore impacts of climate extremes from diverse disciplinary perspectives, and interdisciplinary approaches that bridge conventional subject boundaries. Contributions are encouraged from the natural sciences, medical and health sciences, social and economic sciences, and engineering sciences.

The conference is organised by the **Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes (CLIMES)**, and co-organised by **FutureMed**, the **Earth System Governance Project**, and **TRANSCEND**.
