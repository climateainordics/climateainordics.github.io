The Swedish Climate Symposium will take place in Lund on May 20–22, 2026, serving as a national platform for advancing climate knowledge and action. It brings together researchers, policymakers, and societal stakeholders to explore the latest science, identify knowledge gaps, and solutions for climate adaptation and mitigation. 

The organizers are currently inviting abstract submissions for sessions exploring climate adaptation, mitigation strategies, and the identification of critical data gaps. Hosted by leading institutions—including the Bolin Centre, KTH Climate Action Centre, MERGE, and BECC, this is a unique opportunity to showcase how your work contributes to the global climate efforts.



## Sessions (in selection)

### Remote sensing

This session focuses on leveraging Earth Observation (EO) data to build robust strategies for climate adaptation, risk assessment, and policy integration. With satellites currently monitoring over two-thirds of essential climate variables and providing five decades of historical data, EO offers scalable, data-driven solutions for complex challenges like urban heat islands, flooding, and air pollution. The organizers invite contributions from around the globe that demonstrate how satellite data can support decision-making from local to regional scales.

### AI and digitalization.

This session investigates the impact of AI, Urban Digital Twins, sensors, and citizen sensing apps on climate science, policy, and practice. The organizers invite abstracts—both oral and poster—that cover case studies, theoretical frameworks, or methodologies. The session aims to balance novel opportunities with a critical look at the risks, challenges, and limitations of implementing these digital tools.

**Submission deadline:** 2026-01-30 at 23:59:59 CET.
