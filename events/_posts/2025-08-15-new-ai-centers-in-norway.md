Just before summer, Norway took a major step in strengthening its AI research ecosystem.  
The Research Council of Norway has established six new AI research centers, each bringing together leading universities, research institutes, and industry partners.  
While their primary missions range from health to industry and fundamental AI, several integrate sustainability, societal responsibility, and ethical use of AI as cross-cutting themes.

Over the next 6–12 months, many PhD positions on topics relevant to climate, environment, and the green transition will be announced — creating new opportunities for early-career researchers.  

The centers will be presented in an open online event on **August 26, 2025**, where directors and researchers will share their visions and research agendas.

This event is not organized by or affiliated with Climate AI Nordics.
